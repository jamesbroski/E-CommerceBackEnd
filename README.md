# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

In this activity, we were to create routes for an existing database to build a functional back-end to our application.

We utilized schema and seed commands, mySQL and Sequelize, and also used Insomnia to test if our routes were indeed working since this application wasn't being deployed to a live site.

The user is able to use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in the Insomnia core to view the functionality of this application.

There are also multiple tables in our database, using routes for Categories, Products, and Tags, all communicating with Primary and Foreign Keys.

The user can use "npm run seed" to fill the database and "node server.js" to run the server correctly.

Below is a quick video showing the application's functionality:

Overall, a great activity to learn how the backend can hold data and communicate the data to the front end. Cool!
